    - **Java**: [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and execute the following command in the terminal:

      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - For Node.js, run:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

    - For Python, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    - For Java, use Maven to install dependencies:

      ```bash
      mvn install
      ```

4. **Run the Project**:
    - For Node.js, start the server:

      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

    - For Python, execute:

      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

    - For Java, start the application:

      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```
